This animation shows Son Heung-min's non-penalty shots and goals across 10 Premier League seasons (2015â€“2025).


## Key Takeaways
- **Consistent Scorer:** Son reached double-digit league goals in 8 of his 10 Premier League seasons. The only exceptions? His debut year and his most recent campaign.
- **Open Play Threat:** Despite not taking penalties (with Harry Kane being the primary taker for most of his Spurs career), Son maintained an impressive scoring outputâ€”averaging 78 shots per season, showing his potency in open play.
- **Tactical Fit:** At his best, Son scored many of his goals from central areas inside the boxâ€”perfectly complementing Kane, who often dropped deeper during build-up phases.
- **2024/25 Dip in Form:** This past season raised questions. Son posted career lows in npxG/90, shots/90, and shots on target/90, playing just 2,110 minutesâ€”his lowest league total since 2018/19.
- **Context Matters:** Spurs struggled as a team, and Son was frequently benched post-February to stay fresh for their Europa League run.
- **A New Chapter with Thomas Frank:** The arrival of a coach known for maximizing unconventional forwards (see Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa at Brentford) offers hope for a Son resurgence.
- **The Harsh Reality:** Given Spurs' ruthlessnessâ€”sacking Postecoglou despite a historic European trophyâ€”Son's future at the club is far from guaranteed. If this was his last season, fans can reflect on a decade of iconic moments, ending with a trophy lift in Bilbao. Not every football story ends with a fairytale, but fittingly for Son, this one just might.
